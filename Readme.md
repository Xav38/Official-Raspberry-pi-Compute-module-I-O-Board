After spending a lot of time to find some useful informations about Raspberry Compute module I/O Board, I decided to make this page hoping it'll be useful to someone else.

Fisrt of all, for people like me that didn't find the most basic, meaning the size of the board, here it is : 105mm x 85mm !

I used the official Raspberry Pi documentation and files from that link : https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/master/hardware/computemodule/designfiles.md

I opened the brd file on Orcad Viewer and generate the PDF. I did that in the perspective of making the fritzing part of this CMIO Board.
